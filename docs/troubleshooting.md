# Troubleshooting

Common installation and runtime issues.

## macOS: VS Code click-to-focus focuses the wrong window

### Symptom

Clicking a notification activates VS Code but raises the wrong window (or the last-active window) instead of the project-specific one.

### Why it happens

VS Code window focus requires **Screen Recording** permission (macOS 10.15+) to read window titles across all Spaces. Without it, the binary falls back to plain app activation.

### Fix

On first use the binary requests Screen Recording access automatically — a macOS dialog will appear. If you dismissed it:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording**
2. Enable access for the `claude-notifications` binary (or the terminal running Claude Code)
3. Click the notification again

Once granted, the correct VS Code window will be raised even if it is on a different Space.

## Ubuntu 24.04: `EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted` during `/plugin install`

### Symptom

Plugin installation fails with an error similar to:

```
EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted, rename '.../.claude/plugins/cache/...' -> '/tmp/claude-plugin-temp-...'
```

### Why it happens

Claude Code's plugin installer attempts to move a plugin directory from `~/.claude/...` into `/tmp/...` using `rename()`.
On many Linux systems (including Ubuntu 24.04), `/tmp` is mounted as `tmpfs` (a different filesystem/device), so cross-device `rename()` fails with `EXDEV`.

### Fix (recommended)

Set a temporary directory on the same filesystem as your `~/.claude` (usually under `$HOME`) and start Claude Code from that environment:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/tmp"
TMPDIR="$HOME/.claude/tmp" claude
```

Then retry:

```text
/plugin install claude-notifications-go@claude-notifications-go
```

### Diagnostics (optional)

```bash
df -T "$HOME" /tmp
mount | grep -E ' on /tmp | on /home '
```

If `/tmp` is `tmpfs` (or otherwise on a different device) and `$HOME` is on `ext4/btrfs/...`, the error is expected without the `TMPDIR` workaround.

## Linux: click-to-focus opens the wrong window

### Symptom

Clicking a notification focuses the wrong terminal window, a stale Terminator window, or does nothing.

### Quick diagnostics

Reproduce the failed click first, then run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/main/scripts/linux-focus-debug.sh | bash
```

The script generates a report file in the current directory with:

- `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, `DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `TERM_PROGRAM`, `TERMINATOR_UUID`, `WINDOWID`
- installed plugin version/path and marketplace source
- available focus tools like `xdotool`, `wmctrl`, and `remotinator`
- active-window data, `wmctrl` window lists, `xdotool` searches, and recent plugin log lines

Review the file before posting it publicly, because it may include local file paths and window titles.

### Why this helps

Linux click-to-focus behavior depends on the session type, terminal, window manager, and available focus tools. The diagnostic script captures the exact environment needed to explain why the plugin focused the wrong window or could not focus anything at all.

## Windows: install issues related to `%TEMP%` / `%TMP%` location

If your temp directory is on a different drive than your user profile (or where Claude stores plugin cache), you may see similar cross-device move issues.

### Fix

Make sure `%TEMP%` and `%TMP%` point to a directory on the same drive as `%USERPROFILE%` (or where Claude stores its plugin directories), then restart your terminal/app.

## Windows / Git Bash: binary download fails from GitHub Releases

### Symptom

Bootstrap or `/claude-notifications-go:init` installs the plugin itself, but downloading `claude-notifications-windows-amd64.exe` fails with an empty or generic network error.

### Why it happens

`raw.githubusercontent.com` and `github.com` may still work, but release assets are served from GitHub's release CDN. On corporate Windows machines, Git Bash `curl` often fails there because of:

- Proxy authentication or missing proxy environment variables
- TLS inspection with an untrusted corporate root CA
- Schannel certificate revocation checks blocking the request

### What to check

1. If your company requires a proxy, make sure the terminal running Claude Code or bootstrap has `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY` configured.
2. If your network inspects TLS traffic, ensure Git Bash `curl` trusts the corporate CA certificate.
3. Retry from another network or from WSL to confirm whether the issue is network-specific.
4. As a fallback, open the latest release page, download `claude-notifications-windows-amd64.exe`, place it into the plugin `bin` directory, and then re-run `/claude-notifications-go:init`.
